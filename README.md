### <span style="color:#96c8ff">How To Use</span>

1. Add your GPS, Save it if you want
2. Calculate:
   - **By Next** - Finds the shortest distance from the GPS
   - **By Dist** - It will find all combinations. Calculates the distance and finds the smallest.
3. Now you are done with bad routes

PS: _You can find your **Route** in `Documents\SE_Trader\route.txt` or click **View Route**_

---
### <span style="color:#96c8ff">Install</span>
    üì¢ It will warn you that the software is unsafe. This is because it has no certificate.
       (Too expensive for a student's life)

1. Download **exe** or **msi** file <a href="https://github.com/sobotat/SE_Trader/releases/latest">üìÑ From Here</a>
2. Install it and you are ready to use.

PS: *GPS and Route File is located in `Documents\SE_Trader` folder*

---
### <span style="color:#96c8ff">Work to need to be done</span>

   - Add Settings Page
   - ~~Implement Log System~~
   - Make App Better

---
### <span style="color:#96c8ff">GPS Format</span>

The GPS format is taken from the game.
So there is no need to redo anything. <br>
In case you want to use the app for other things. <br> 
The GPS consists of a name, x, y, z coordinates and a color in hex.

```text
---:NAME---:X------:Y------:Z------:COLOR--:
GPS:Station:25000.5:25000.5:25000.5:#96c8ff:
```
